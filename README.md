<ins>Abstract:</ins> 
*In this era of Internet and World Wide Web, where everything is connected, study of large and random web-like network has become of great eminence. 
The authors Deo and Cami proposed a discrete-time dynamic random graph model where nodes are both added (along with edge) and deleted preferentially. 
They studied different properties such as growth in the number of nodes and edges with respect to steps, degree distribution of deleted nodes and overall 
degree distribution of the graph model and showed that this model follows the power-law degree distribution. Here, I have tried to reimplement their work 
by generating their proposed network model and then analyzed the relation of growth rate of nodes, edges, degree distribution of deleted nodes and degree 
distribution of the whole graph with respect to the number of iterations. The results were promising and they conceded with the results of the paper discussed here.*

Title: Analyzing and Comparing the Behavior of Real-life Web-like Network
Abstract:  
*In this era of Internet and World Wide Web, where everything is connected, study of large and random web-like network has become of great eminence. The authors Deo and Cami proposed a discrete-time dynamic random graph model where nodes are both added (along with edge) and deleted preferentially. They studied different properties such as growth in the number of nodes and edges with respect to steps, degree distribution of deleted nodes and overall degree distribution of the graph model and showed that this model follows the powerlaw degree distribution. Here, using the dynamic random graph model proposed by Deo et al, (1) I have analyzed real-life data collected from a survey done on the users of the well-known social networking site ‘Facebook’. (2) Then I have compared the results with the results obtained from Deo et al. proposed model and showed how much the discovered properties of dynamic random graph model correspond with the real life example. (3) I have also improvised the proposed model by adding preferential
addition and deletion of edges to the existing model and showed how the number of nodes and edges change with respect to the number of iterations. (4) I also proposed a different equation for the preferential deletion of nodes and showed how the results changes using that equation. (5) Finally, I tried to introduce a new property of the existing dynamic random graph model by separately analyzing the degree distribution of the old nodes and newly added nodes in the graph and showed how their cumulative probability distribution differ for higher and lower values of degrees.
