<ins>Abstract:</ins> 
*In this era of Internet and World Wide Web, where everything is connected, study of large and random web-like network has become of great eminence. 
The authors Deo and Cami proposed a discrete-time dynamic random graph model where nodes are both added (along with edge) and deleted preferentially. 
They studied different properties such as growth in the number of nodes and edges with respect to steps, degree distribution of deleted nodes and overall 
degree distribution of the graph model and showed that this model follows the power-law degree distribution. Here, I have tried to reimplement their work 
by generating their proposed network model and then analyzed the relation of growth rate of nodes, edges, degree distribution of deleted nodes and degree 
distribution of the whole graph with respect to the number of iterations. The results were promising and they conceded with the results of the paper discussed here.*
